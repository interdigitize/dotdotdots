There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Dot Dot Dots ##

This web app is a digital rendition of Yayoi Kusama's dot-covered Obliteration Room for people interested in collaborative creation and art.

Here is an excerpt from an article about Yayoi's installation:

  > The art museum original is built as a traditional, prefabricated american suburban house with white interiors, containing familiar household objects such as a kitchen counter, couch, and teapot, all painted white.

  > As visitors enter, they are handed a set of stickers, each a different brightly colored dot of a varying size. Visitors are asked to leave their mark wherever they choose, placing the circle stickers anywhere they like. The space gradually transforms as a result of the interaction and the mass accumulation of the dots ultimately changes the white interior into an unrecognizable blur of colors.

## What problem does this solve? ##
Not everyone can travel somewhere to see an exhibition. A digital rendition changes the experience, but it is more accessible and furthers the concept and ability to participate.

## How to Get Started ##
 Once you land on the page, you can add dots, similar to adding stickers in the real space. You can also leave a note on the dots you add. As you hover over previously added dots you can read notes that were left.
